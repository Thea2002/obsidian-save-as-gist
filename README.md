## Obsidian Save as Gist

This plugin provides two commands

- Save current file in a private Gist
- Save current selection in a private Gist

In order to use it you will have to generate a [GitHub API Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with "Create Gist" permission and set it using the plugin's settings.

Once the gist is created **the Gist URL will be copied to your Clipboard**.

### Notes

- it's currently not possible to generate a public gist
- it's currently not possible to update a gist
